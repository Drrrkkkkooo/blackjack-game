                    <h4>The Goal</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        The primary objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's 
                        hand without the total value of your cards exceeding 21. Hitting a total of exactly 21 on the first two cards 
                        (an Ace and a 10-value card) is called a "Blackjack" or a 
                        "natural," which typically results in an immediate win at 3-to-2 odds.

                    <h4>Card Values</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Jacks, Queens, 
                        and Kings (face cards) are all worth 10 points. An Ace is a flexible card and can be counted as ei
                        ther 1 point or 11 points. Players will always count the Ace 
                        as 11 unless doing so would make their hand total exceed 21 (a "bust"), in which case it counts as 1.
                    </p>

                <section class="paragraph">
                    <h4>Starting the Game</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                    Once the cards are dealt, the player has several options to improve
                        their hand: Hit (take an additional card), Stand (keep the current hand and end their turn), Double Down (double the bet and take exactly one more card, then stand), and Split 
                    (if the first two cards are of equal rank, the player can split
                        them into two separate hands by placing a second, equal bet).
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="paragraph">
                    <h4>Dealer's Turn and Winning</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        After all players have completed their actions, 
                        the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must follow strict rules: they must hit on any total of 16 or less and must stand on any total of 17 or more (including a "soft 17"—an Ace and a 6). If the player's total is closer to 21 than the dealer's total without exceeding 21, the player wins the amount of their bet (1-to-1 odds). 
                        If both the player and dealer have the same total, 
                        it is a Push (a tie), and the player's bet is returned.
